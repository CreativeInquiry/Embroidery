## Preparing the Machine for Embroidery:

In this section, we will go over how to prepare the machine for embroidery. You will want to do this with the machine *off*. This will require us to attach the embroidery unit, and the embroidery foot, and optionally an embroidery needle.

### Changing the Needle
*make sure the machine is off*

You will need to change the needle if the needle is broken, or if you need to switch between an embroidery needle and sewing needle. Note that both work in embroidery mode, but the embroidery needle is less prone to fraying or breaking the thread.

Loosen the needle screw with the screwdriver, this will allow you to pull the needle out through the bottom. Once it's out, you can insert the new needle upwards with the flat side away from you. Push it all the way up, and then tighten the needle screw with the screwdriver

### Changing the foot
*make sure the machine is off*


With the power off, remove the current foot.

## Preparing to Embroider
Make sure the needle is fully raised and the machine is turned off before inserting or removing the bobbin.
1. Open the bobbin cover by pushing the release button to the right (A). Remove the cover (B). 
2. Insert the bobbin in the bobbin case with the thread running in a counterclockwise direction. 
3. With a finger held gently on top of the bobbin, pull the thread into notch (C). Then pull the thread at arrow
markings into the needle plate thread guide from (C) to (D). Pull the thread at the arrow markings into the needle
plate thread guide from (D) to (E). To cut off excess thread, pull thread to the right, over the blade (E).
4. Replace the bobbin cover

To put the fabric into the hoop, place the outer hoop on the table,open the quick release(A)and loosen the screw(B). Put the fabric backing and fabric on top of the hoop, with the fabric on the topmost. Then, place the inner hoop on top of the fabric, and press it firmly into the outer hoop. Close the quick release, and turn the screw until the fabric is secured firmly. The fabric should be taut for best results.

## Machine Basics 

### Raising/Lowering the Presser Foot

![Slide hoop on or off](./images/adjust_presser_foot.png)

The presser foot is lowered or raised with the presser foot lift
(A). If you are sewing on heavy fabric or several layers of
fabric, the presser foot can be raised higher (B) to make it
easier to place the fabric underneath the presser foot.

### Raising/Lowering the Needle
