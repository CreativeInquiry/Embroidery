This is an Image of the right side of the machine. Plug the power cord into the power socket (B). Once the power cord is plugged in, turn the power switch to the 'on' position (C). Though not needed for embroidery, the presser foot can be plugged into the socket on the left side (A)

##Switching to Embroidery Mode
In this section, we will go over how to prepare the machine for embroidery. You will want to do this with the machine _off_. This will require us to attach the embroidery unit, and the embroidery foot.

To put the fabric into the hoop, place the outer hoop on the table,open the quick release(A)and loosen the screw(B). Put the fabric backing and fabric on top of the hoop, with the fabric on the topmost. Then, place the inner hoop on top of the fabric, and press it firmly into the outer hoop. Close the quick release, and turn the screw until the fabric is secured firmly. The fabric should be taut for best results.

###Attaching Hoop 
Don't attach the hoop untill the machine tells you too.
