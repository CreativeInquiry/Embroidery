# Creating a File
For this we will be using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), and a third party extension, [ink-stitch](https://inkstitch.org/).
/note I have archived these programs in the repository/


Download ink-stitch and follow the installation guide, then open inkscape. You can draw freehand or trace an image. For this example I’ve imported a drawing I’d previously scanned and brought it into Inkscape.

##Creating an Outline

For this you will need to set your fill to nothing, and turn on your stroke. (see inkscape basics)


#Using Inkscape
##Changing Stroke and Fill

This is the default layout. From this screen you can change the stroke and fill of yor selected object

The controls on the right allow you to change the stroke and fill options by adjusting the colors or setting the option to 'no fill' or 'no stroke'.
